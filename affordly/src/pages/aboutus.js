            The application proposed is a one stop portal for anyone who is trying to buy or sell
furniture, clothes, home accessories, or any other used goods. For now, we will be focusing
on the population of Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Our segments will include people
who are looking to buy cheap and readily available goods from people in their
neighborhood. These people could be university students moving in Halifax and trying to
gather as much stuff as possible for minimal prices, or the students moving out after
completing their degrees, seeking to sell their stuff and earn some extra money. Hence,
this website will provide a platform where buyers and sellers can connect and engage in
easy, cheap and accessible trade. This goes beyond just students. People moving in and
out of the city always find themselves shopping and then discarding the items. We believe
that most of our users will be from the above-mentioned segments, however people trying
to get rid of their old stuff will find the ease and accessibility of using our application helpful.

            As a brand, our application tends to communicate the message of ‘reuse and save’. Our
application resonates with the idea of being thrifty yet living a luxurious life. The message
ties well with our primary target audience i.e. people who are living temporarily in HRM, like
students, migrant workers etc.
Another important idea behind the brand is dependability and trustworthiness. The well
thought out and prudently designed application will inspire a sense of trust among the
users. The idea behind the practice is to make users feel secure about the information they
are entering on our website. The website is also designed in an aesthetic manner, which
ensures that users can navigate through key features seamlessly.

            Our application has several competitors in the market. Some of the top competition that we
face is from already established companies like Kijiji, Wayfair, used.ca and legto.
We also face competition from the retail sector, Value Village in NS being our biggest
competitor.
We provide a discussion forum, which is
a first of its kind feature in a website. The discussion forum will allow users to discuss the
quality of the product and make decisions in general.
